Git vs GitHub

Git

Git is the command line version control system (VCS) software which works on your local computer.
Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
You need Git to use GitHub. You can use Git locally without GitHub.
GitHub

GitHub is an internet hosting service for git repositories. Public repos are free; private repos are paid.
As a shared space for repos, it allows you to do collaborative work.
Two Common Collaborative Work Flows

Shared Repository Model

For small projects where you are basically in the same physical space (e.g. lab with offices near each other).
Be careful! You are cloning the main repository.
Everyone has push and pull access to the central repo, so be careful and:
Never commit to the master directly.
Always do your work on a different branch from master.
Basic Shared Repository Workflow

update your local repo with git pull origin master,
create a working branch with git checkout -b MyNewBranch
make your changes on your branch and stage them with git add,
commit your changes locally with git commit -m "description of your commit", and
upload the changes (including your new branch) to GitHub with git push origin MyNewBranch
Go to the main repo on GitHub where you should now see your new branch
click on your branch name
click on "Pull Request" button (URC)
click on "Send Pull Request"
Fork and Pull Model

This is the model used by U of T Coders on its own website and repos.
The "owner"/"Project Leader" of the upstream repo assigns rights to "Collaborators"
Collaborators do not have push access to main (upstream) repo
Project Lead accepts Pull Requests (PRs) fro collaborators, reviews them, then merges them into main repo.
Fork and Pull Workflow

to be demonstrated during lesson
Some Git Terminology/Jargon

Repos and Branches

Term	Description
Origin (repo)	Your remote repo; it is the "origin" for your local copy. Either it is a repo you created yourself or it is a fork of someone else's GitHub repo.
Upstream (repo)	The main repo from which you forked your GiHub repo.
Local (repo)	The repo on your local computer.
Master	The main branch (version) of your repo.
Basic Commands/Actions

Term	Explanation
Fork	Make a copy of someone else's GitHub repo in your own GitHub repo.
Clone	Make a copy of the your GitHub repo on your local computer. In CLI: 'git clone' copies a remote repo to create a local repo with a remote called origin automatically set up.
Pull	You incorporate changes into your repo.
Add	Adding snapshots of your changes to the "Staging" area.
Commit	Takes the files as they are in your staging area and stores a snap shot of your files (changes) permanentaly in your Git directory.
Push	You "push" your files (changes) to the remote repo.
Merge	Incorporate changes into the branch you are on.
Pull Request	Term used in collaboration. You "issue a pull request" to the owner of the upstream repo asking them to pull your changes into their repo (accept your work).
Configuring git global settings on your local computer

You only have to do this once; global settings apply to all your git repos.
Note: Any Local settings you initiate within individual git repositories will over ride global settings.

username
email
display colours
preferred text editor
Command line git syntax is: git verb

$ git config --global user.name "Albert Einstein"
$ git config --global user.email "bertie@worlduniversity.edu"
$ git config --global color.ui "auto"
Use your own name and email address instead of Einstein's. This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity, which means that any changes pushed to a Git host server will include this information.

For this lesson, we will be interacting with GitHub and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review GitHubâ€™s instructions for keeping your email address private. If you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use that same email address for the user.email value, e.g. username@users.noreply.github.com replacing username with your GitHub one. You can change the email address later on by using the git config command again.

Set up your favorite text editor (default editor):

$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
See https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/ for settings for other text editors

Exercise 1

Two Person Collaboration via the CLI - Shared Repo Workflow (without branches)

This exercise is based on the SWC Git Novice lesson https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab/

One of you will be the "Owner" and one of you will be the "Collaborator."

A. Owner gives collaborator access to their repo.

Go to your GitHub repo
Add a file called "tenlines.txt" and put the text from the etherpad into the file. Commit your changes.
Click on Settings tab.
Click Collaborators
Enter collaborataors username
B. Collaborator clones Owner's Repo

Go to https://github.com/notifications and accept access to Owner's repo.
On the CLI, clone the owner's repo but issuing the commmand:
$ git clone URL-of-Origin-Repo Directory-Address-of-Local-Repo
C. Collaborator works on clone of Owner's Repo

Go to your cloned repo:
$ cd ~/.../yourClone

Open editor and revise working file:
atom tenlines.txt

Commit your changes to your local repo:
$ git add tenlines.txt
$ git commit -m "your commit message"

Push your changes to the Owner's repo on GitHub:
$ git push origin master

D. Owner review and accepts changes from Collaborator

Look at Owner's GitHub repo and see new commit(s) from Collaborator.

Download (pull) Collaborators changes to Owner's local repo:
$ git pull origin master

Exercise 2

Dealing with Merge Conflicts

This section is based on the SWC Git Novice lesson https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/09-conflict/

When two or more people work on the same files, conflicts are bound to occur. Version control will help notify us when there are conflicts. It will be up to the humans to sort out which changes to retain.

The file "tenlines.txt" currently looks like this:
$ cat tenlinestxt

Let's say Person A adds a line to the file and review:
$ atom tenlines.txt
$ cat tenlines.txt

and pushes changes to GitHub:
$ git add tenlines.txt
$ git commit -m "added a line in local copy and pushed to remote"
$ git push origin master

Now, Person B modifies her local file without first updating it (pulling the repo) from GitHub:
Add a line to the file and review:
$ atom tenlines.txt
$ cat tenlines.txt

Commit the changes locally:
$ git add tenlines.txt
$ git commit -m "added a line in local copy"

But when we push, Git will not allow this because there were changes to the same line in the two files:
$ git push origin master

To resolve the conflict, you need to pull the changes from GitHub, merge them into your local copy, and then push it back to GitHub
$ git pull origin master

Git tells us there is a conflict and tells you the file it's in.
Let's look at the file:
cat tenlines.txt

Git has put some new info in our file:

<<<<<<<<<<<<< HEAD
our text
========
Other persons's text
>>>>>>>>

You need to open your text editor and make the changes which is the accepted version by you and your collaborator:
atom tenfiles.txt

Then, to finish mergining, you need to add, commit, and push your changes back to GitHub:
$ git add tenlines.txt

You can verify the status of your repo first, then commit and push:
$ git status
$ git commit -m "Merged changes from GitHub"
$ git push origin master

Git keeps track that a conflict has been resolved and what was merged into what so when Person A who made the first changes pulls from GitHub, she doesn't have to fix things and merge again.

Person A pull and sees new version of the file:
$ git pull origina master
$ cat tenlines.txt

Exercise 3
